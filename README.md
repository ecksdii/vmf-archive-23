# vmf-archive-23

An archive of most of my old VMFs/JMFs for various Valve games, includes both released and unreleased maps.

Some map sources were lost to a hard disk crash, though it's not related to *anything noteworthy* https://gamebanana.com/mods/118009 *cough*

Some file dates may be incorrect because of Hammer++ randomly autosaving while I was checking these files out again.
